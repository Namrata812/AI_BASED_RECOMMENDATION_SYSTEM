ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS:

Tool Used : IntelliJ IDEA

The goal is to create a recommendation system that analyzes user-item interactions and suggests products or items on similarities between users. The system will leverage collaborative filtering, a popular technique that predicts a user's interests by identifying patterns in the preferences of similar users or items.

I performed the tasks like gathering data, storing data and then analyzing the data to identify the patterns of an user. After that find out the similarities between the users by knowing the ratings given by the user on purchased items. on the basis of the above information the list of the predicted items (which are similar or related to the user interest) is created for a particular user and that list will be recommend to the user.
